Language Specification
======================

This document is Plinth's Language Specification, which documents each feature of the language in detail. If you find any omissions, please notify the author.

.. note::

   Plinth is currently a work-in-progress. As such, parts of this specification are incomplete, missing, or not representative of the final language. New features will be added here once they are added to the reference implementation of the compiler.
